    I am going to be the king of pirates</h3>

    <p style="align-self: center;">Monkey D. Luffy, also known as "Straw Hat Luffy" and commonly as "Straw Hat",[10] is the founder and captain of the increasingly infamous and powerful Straw Hat Pirates, as well as the most powerful of its top fighters.[26][27] He desires to find the legendary treasure left behind by the late Gol D. Roger and thereby become the Pirate King,[28] which would help facilitate an unknown dream of his that he has told only to Shanks, his brothers and crew.[29][30] 
        He believes that being the Pirate King means having the most freedom in the world.[31]</p>
